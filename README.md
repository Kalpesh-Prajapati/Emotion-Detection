# Emotion Detection Using OpenCV and Haar Cascades

This project detects emotions in real time using facial features. It uses OpenCV for image processing and Haar cascades for face detection. The script captures webcam input, detects faces, and predicts emotions like happy, sad, or angry using expression analysis.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Emotion Detection.py` – Main Python script for running emotion detection
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` – Haar cascade model for face detection

## 🚀 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
````

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure the Haar cascade XML file is in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python "Emotion Detection.py"
```

4. A window will open showing webcam feed with detected face and predicted emotion.

## 📷 Example Output

The script will display a webcam feed with bounding boxes and predicted emotions on faces.
